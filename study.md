Gauss get me a line out of here.
## Analytical
real and complex numbers have an argument on how to slice vegetables.

# Statistics and Data Science
Maybe I should just do all this in R.

can be found after mathematical modelling in NCERT class 11 textbook.

# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Hahaha, sure. Yeah, that'll work out. Seriously.
