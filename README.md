# GYLT
One repository to rule them all.

[//]: # (Suggested project name by @Github was `vigilant-intention` but I chose to keep it GYLT to stay reminded what the intent is.)
This repo should not stay messy for long.

## Global Problematics

+ [14/2/19] The underworld of illegal dogfighting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD8ZGC1XeaU
+ [13/2/19] College Tuition and Student Loans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWJ0OaojfiA
+ [10/2/19] Need to go back into research. Xanax caused 126 deaths in the UK last year alone. How would you prevent abuse?
+ [17/3/19] Fear of the dark and the unknown: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-are-likely-to-be-eaten-by-a-grue
+ [4/4/19] Lethargy, Inactivity and Fear of Criticism : Do things, fail lots. Better to be known as a doer who fails than a quitter who fails. Fail gracefully, fall humble, fall with humity and dignity and elegance. Be elequant; go out to win an extempore. Be quaint, be honest, be peace, be humble. Sit down.
+ [11/4/19] Communication: The difficulty of staying connected and in conteact. The hardship of navigating through the expiry of social group interactions and group disolves. Finding new connections and growing relations into fruitful industries.

## Embarrasments and Guilt

It's true that not all commits are productive. Sometime's they're done to keep the garden green and activity streaks going. This is not fair actually. There has to be a development pipeline and a review process. It's up to individual developers to implement their own DevOps practices, the simplest of which is to make a substantial number of commits locally before pushing to remote as a single push. This sounds like bad practices to someone writing thousands of lines of code in a single day but really, this advice is for that programmer searching for the one perfect line of code to get something done. Rather than wasting space with unecessary dables of edits, we can have one clean looking change to the master file. Isn't that a good dream to have? Push in your thoughts.

I forgot no one reads any of this.
